# Refined Prime Video

> Browser extension that simplifies the Amazon Prime Video interface

I really like Amazon Prime Video for its original series and the wide range of great—and sometimes horribly bad—movies you watch with its subscription, but there are some things that *really* annoy me about its user interface.

So, inspired by the [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github) browser extension which improves the user experience on GitHub, I decided to create my own browser extension to do the same thing for Prime Video.

## Features

- Improved top navigation that hides everything unrelated to Prime Video
- No more (or at least less) banners that clutter the page
- No annoying tips that you already know
- No unnecessary purchase links
