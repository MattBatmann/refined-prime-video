# Refined Prime Video

> Browser extension that simplifies the Amazon Prime Video interface

Amazon Prime Video is great but its interface is cluttered with annoying banners and useless information. So, inspired by the [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github) browser extension which improves the user experience on GitHub, I decided to create my own browser extension to do the same thing for Prime Video.

**Note:** This extension was created to enhance the country-specific Prime Video sites (like amazon.de/video). If you are using primevideo.com, you're fortunate: You don't *need* this extension.

## Installation

- [**Chrome** extension][cws-link] [<img valign="middle" src="https://img.shields.io/chrome-web-store/v/pieemlagbhnombolehnjdoaoojpphedd.svg?label=download&style=flat-square&logoColor=white">][cws-link]
- **Opera** extension: Use [this Opera extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/) to install the Chrome version.

## Features

- Improved top navigation that hides everything unrelated to Prime Video
- No more (or at least less) banners that clutter the page
- No annoying tips that you already know
- No unnecessary purchase links
