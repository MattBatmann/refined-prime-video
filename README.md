# Refined Prime Video

> Browser extension that simplifies the Amazon Prime Video interface and adds useful features

*Amazon Prime Video* is great but its interface is cluttered and it lacks features that series enthusiasts would like to have. So, inspired by the [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github) browser extension which improves the user experience on GitHub, I decided to create my own browser extension that does the same thing for Prime Video.

**Note:** This extension was created to enhance the country-specific *Prime Video* sites like amazon.de/video. If you are using primevideo.com, you're fortunate: You don't *need* this extension.

## Installation

- [**Chrome** extension][cws-link]: [<img valign="middle" src="https://img.shields.io/chrome-web-store/v/pieemlagbhnombolehnjdoaoojpphedd.svg?label=download&style=flat-square">][cws-link]
- [**Firefox** addon][amo-link]: [<img valign="middle" src="https://img.shields.io/amo/v/refined-prime-video.svg?label=download&style=flat-square">][amo-link]
- **Opera** extension: Use [this Opera extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/) to install the Chrome version.

## Features

### Hide spoilers

Accidentally scrolling too far down and catching a glimpse of a spoiler sucks. Refined Prime Video allows you to hide them by blurring the thumbnails and hiding the descriptions of episodes you haven't watched yet. You can control when that happens through a dropdown to the right of the season selector.

### Improved top navigation

When watching movies or series, you don't care about what's in your *Shopping Basket* or what *Today's Deals* are. Refined Prime Video removes the default Amazon navigation and widens the search bar so you can more quickly find the movies and series you love.

### Clean user interface

At least the German *Prime Video* is cluttered with annoying banners telling you about supposedly *new* features that have existed for ages and other useless elements like share buttons or a note about their terms of use. Refined Prime Video gets rid of these things.
